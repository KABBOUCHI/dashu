# Roadmap to v0.1

- [ ] Remove operations between different signedness
- [ ] Add operations between UBig and IBig (the result should be IBig)
- [ ] Format code and inspect inline/pub(crate) markers
- [ ] Add more tests to cover cases with inline double words
- [ ] Add documentation for internal modules as well.
- [ ] Check all "legacy" marks and bump MSRV to maybe 1.57? (with const assert support)
